// Exercise 1: Calculate the Sum of Two Numbers

(Your pseudocode here)

// I want to use integers because integers store values such as numbers.
// Calculating the sum I would add two values to equal another value.
// I want to then print out the statement with the sum

int x = 2; // integer 1
int y = 5; // integer 2
int z = x + y; // SUM
printf("The sum of x plus y is " + z); // print statment


// Exercise 2: Check if a Number is Even or Odd

(Your pseudocode here)
// With C++ code
// initiate an integer that is num. integer taking in a value that the user inputs.
// using if statements
// if a num has a remainder (%) after dividing it with num and 2 equal == 0 then it is even. 
// else it will be an odd number.

int num;                           // integer
printf("Please enter a number: "); // print statement asking for input
cin >> num;                        // users actual input

 if(num % 2 == 0)   // I am using open and closed brackets because I am closing these statements so they are essetnially "their own" just like how it would be bracketed in a main function
 {
  cout << num << " is an even number!" << endl;        // print statements
 }
 else{
  cout << num << " is a odd number!" << endl;          // print statements
 }
}

// Exercise 3: 
Write pseudo code that will perform the following.    

a) Read in 5 separate numbers.   
b) Calculate the average of the five numbers.
c) Find the smallest (minimum) and largest (maximum) of the five entered numbers.
d) Write out the results found from steps b and c with a message describing what they are

(Your pseudocode here)

// Initiate 5 integers (a, b, c, d, e) for the input of values
// Inititate integer avg because it will be the value of the average of all the integers that were input by the user
// I wanted to make functions so that the values can be read in the function to be able to "go through" all the values
// Comparing the user input values to determine which is Min and Max.
// Two seperate functions going into this code
// One function will be to compare all values that were input with if statements to weave out to find the min
// Other function will do the same comparing all the values that were input and use if statements to find the max
// The two functions if working with C++ would go above main. Because they will be called back into main. 
// the avg int value is going to store/equal all 5 values added up and divided by 5 to find the average.


int a, b, c, d, e, avg;                                  		 // integer values

avg = ((a+b+c+d+e)/5);                                    		// this is the value to find the average

cin >> a >> b >> c >> d >> e; 						 //input from the users

int MaxNumber(a, b, c, d, e){ 						//FUNCTION FOR MAX NUM
   int maxNum = a; 							// variable in function setting it to MAX to compare
   if( b > maxNum){ 							// if b is bigger than  MAX then b max
      maxNum = b;
   }
   if(c > maxNum){ 							// if c is bigger than  MAX then c max
      maxNum = c;
   }
   if(d > maxNum){ 							// if d is bigger than  MAX then d max
      maxNum = d;
   }
   if(e > maxNum){ 					                // if e is bigger than MAX then e max
   }
      return maxNum;
}

int MinNumber(a, b, c, d, e){ // function for Min			//FUNCTION FOR MIN NUM
   int minNum = a; 							// variable in function setting it to MAX to compare	
                      							
   if(b<minNum){ //if b is less than  MIN then min b 			// if b is smaller than  MIN then b min
      minNum = num2;
   }
   if(c < minNum){ //if c is less than  MIN then min c  		// if c is smalller than  MIN then c min
      minNum = num3;
   }
   if(d < minNum){ //if d is less than  MIN then min d      		 // if d is smaller than  MIN then d min
      minNum = d;
   }
   if(e < minNum){ // if e is less than MIN then min e 			// if e is smaller than MIN then e min
   }
      return minNum;
}

cout << "Maximum is " << MaxNumber(a, b, c, d, e) << endl;  // In this statment after it is calling back the function MaxNumber to be able to compare all the input values (a, b, c, d, e)

cout << "Minimum is " << MinNumber(a, b, c, d, e) << endl;   // In this statment after it is calling back the function MinNumber to be able to compare all the input values (a, b, c, d, e)


cout << "The average is " << avg << endl;                   // In this statment the output is going to say the avgerage. It is calling back the value of avg
