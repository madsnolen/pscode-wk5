// Exercise 1: Calculate the Sum of Two Numbers

(Your pseudocode here)
int x = 2;
int y = 5;
int z = x + y;
printf("The sum of x plus y is " + z);


// Exercise 2: Check if a Number is Even or Odd

(Your pseudocode here)

int num;
printf("Please enter a number: ");
cin >> num;
 if(num % 2 == 0)
 {
  cout << num << " is an even number!" << endl;
 }
 else{
  cout << num << " is a odd number!" << endl;
 }
}

// Exercise 3: 
Write pseudo code that will perform the following.    

a) Read in 5 separate numbers.   
b) Calculate the average of the five numbers.
c) Find the smallest (minimum) and largest (maximum) of the five entered numbers.
d) Write out the results found from steps b and c with a message describing what they are

(Your pseudocode here)

int a, b, c, d, e, avg;

avg = ((a+b+c+d+e)/5);

cin >> a >> b >> c >> d >> e; //input from the users

int MaxNumber(a, b, c, d, e){ //FUNCTION
   int maxNum = a; // variable in function setting it to MAX to compare
   if( b > maxNum){ // if b is bigger than  MAX then b max
      maxNum = b;
   }
   if(c > maxNum){ // if c is bigger than  MAX then c max
      maxNum = c;
   }
   if(d > maxNum){ // if d is bigger than  MAX then d max
      maxNum = d;
   }
   if(e > maxNum){ // if e is bigger than MAX then e max
   }
      return maxNum;
}

int MinNumber(a, b, c, d, e){ // function for Min
   int minNum = a; // I tried at first setting minNum as an int and then define it in if statement
                      // had to initiate the first num as min so it can be compared throughout the line
   if(b<minNum){ //if b is less than  MIN then min b
      minNum = num2;
   }
   if(c < minNum){ //if c is less than  MIN then min c
      minNum = num3;
   }
   if(d < minNum){ //if d is less than  MIN then min d
      minNum = d;
   }
   if(e < minNum){ // if e is less than MIN then min e
   }
      return minNum;
}

cout << "Maximum is " << MaxNumber(a, b, c, d, e) << endl; // Function used for input answers

cout << "Minimum is " << MinNumber(a, b, c, d, e) << endl; // Function used for input answers

cout << "The average is " << avg << endl;
